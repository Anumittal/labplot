LabPlot 2 & SciDAVis
--------------------

In Sep. 2008, the LabPlot project and the SciDAVis project (scidavis.sourceforge.net) started a close collaboration. 
The plan is to share a common backend with two frontends: KDE based (LabPlot) and Qt-only (SciDAVis).

LabPlot 2 is a complete rewrite of LabPlot 1.X.

###############

Building LabPlot (KDE frontend):
--------------------------------

# ./build
# make install

Clean-up:
# ./clean


Building SciDAvis (Qt frontend):
--------------------------------

# cd src/qtfrontend
# qmake-qt4 scidavis.pro
# make
# make install (optional, not needed for most development tasks)

If the Qt frontend is build any other way, make sure that ACTIVATE_SCIDAVIS_SPECIFIC_CODE is defined in the Makefile.

###############

This project is currently under active development.
See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/labplot/index.php?title=Main_Page for more informations.

SciDAVis introduces an abstraction of the application design called "aspect framework" or "5 layer model". 
Very short description:
Every object (aspect) in a project is placed in a hierarchy with the project as the root node. Every aspect
itself has 5 layers of functionality: 
layer 0: data
layer 1: undo commands
layer 2: public API
layer 3: Qt models
lyeer 4: GUI (including Qt views), scripting
Long description: see src/qtfrontend/doc/aspect-framework.dox 
(or generate Doxygen docs by "doxygen Doxyfile" in the qtfrontend dir)
