LabPlot is a KDE-application for interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data.
LabPlot provides an easy way to create, manage and edit plots. It allows you to produce
plots based on data from a spreadsheet or on data imported from external files. Plots 
can be exported to several pixmap and vector graphic formats.
