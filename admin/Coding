* Our approach also is to put as much code as possible into the aspect 
	(or its view) that it is related to rather than the
	main window. So we prefer (in pseudo code, just to show the principle)
	activeWindow().aspect().showMeYourContextMenu(Position)
	over
	if (activeWindowType() == spreadsheet) openSpreadSheetContextMenu(Position)

* I would be better for Spreadsheet not depend on MainWin at all.
	But if you really need it, this is the "SciDAVis way" of getting a pointer to the main window: - Tilman

	if (m_table->project() == NULL) return;
	MainWin * mw = static_cast<MainWin *>(m_table->project()->view());

*Remarks about the Labplot/SciDAVis integration of class Project:
	- save/open: the stream based XML reading and writing is faster than using DOM.
		  If you want, you can of course use DOM instead. - Tilman
